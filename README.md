# PSA: Changes are happening

From August 2018 onwards, Linuxserver are in the midst of switching to a new CI platform which will enable us to build and release multiple architectures under a single repo. To this end, existing images for `arm64` and `armhf` builds are being deprecated. They are replaced by a manifest file in each container which automatically pulls the correct image for your architecture. You'll also be able to pull based on a specific architecture tag.

TLDR: Multi-arch support is changing from multiple repos to one repo per container image.

[Ldap-auth](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ldap-auth) software is for authenticating users who request protected resources from servers proxied by nginx. It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that communicates with an authentication server, and a webserver daemon that generates an authentication cookie based on the userâ€™s credentials. The daemons are written in Python for use with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server (OpenLDAP or Microsoft Windows Active Directory 2003 and 2012).

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `X86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list). 

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| X86-64 | tbc |
| arm64 | tbc |
| armhf | tbc |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=ldap-auth \
  -e PUID=1001 \
  -e PGID=1001 \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  linuxserver/ldap-auth
```


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2"
services:
  ldap-auth:
    image: linuxserver/ldap-auth
    container_name: ldap-auth
    environment:
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
    ports:
      - 8888:8888
      - 9000:9000
    mem_limit: 4096m
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8888` | the port for ldap auth daemon |
| `-p 9000` | the port for ldap login page |
| `-e PUID=1001` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1001` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

&nbsp;
## Application Setup

- This container itself does not have any settings and it relies on the pertinent information passed through in http headers of incoming requests. Make sure that your webserver is set up with the right config.
- Here's a sample config: [nginx-ldap-auth.conf](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ldap-auth/blob/master/nginx-ldap-auth.conf).



## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it ldap-auth /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f ldap-auth`
* container version number 
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' ldap-auth`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' linuxserver/ldap-auth`

## Versions

* **11.08.18:** - Initial release.
